watch <command>
watch kubectl get pods
```

### find_port

find_port <port>
```

### reload

### dev

Spin up your dev environment as a docker container, either by specifying a directory via `dev .` or by specifying a docker volume name such as `dev avatar`, or by entering your `REMOTE_DEV_ENV` via the `dev` command.

#### Parameters

All parameters are persisted in `~/.environments.json' along with the environment name, and are automatically loaded when an environment is started. 
The values are overridden and overwritten if a parameter is specified. To clear the parameters for an environment, provide the option with a value of 'null'.
